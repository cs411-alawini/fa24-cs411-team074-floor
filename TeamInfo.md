## Project Summary

Gambit Gallery is a centralized online platform where users can play their favorite strategy-based card games with their friends, with games available for multiplayer play such as Mahjong, Poker, and other classic titles. Each game  is its own entity, and players can play unlimited rounds for each game so long as every other player is also willing to continue and each has the currency to join. 

On this platform, users can login and access a shared in-game currency that is used across all games. While each game will be its own separate entity with its own animations and designs, all games will use this same central currency. This currency can be earned primarily through winning a game where currency is bet, or passively through daily quests given by our platform so all players can play. Of course, the currency can also be deducted through actions such as placing bets, or paying entry fees for limited time event games. This fosters a simple ecosystem where players can use one currency to play whatever game that they want, rather than having to play on different platforms or the pressure of using real money. There is also a gifting system, where players can gift currency to other players to promote collaboration and goodwill.
